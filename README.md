## Introduction

In the age of decentralization, organizations need innovative solutions to manage their internal processes transparently and securely. The Cooperative Proposals Management DApp is designed to meet this need by providing a decentralized platform for proposal creation, voting, and member management. By leveraging blockchain technology, this DApp ensures that all actions are recorded on an immutable ledger, fostering trust and accountability.

## Features

- **Member Management:** Register new members with a unique ID and address.
- **Proposal Creation:** Create proposals with multiple voting options.
- **Voting System:** Members can vote on proposals, ensuring democratic decision-making.
- **Automatic Voting Closure:** Proposals close automatically when the voting period ends.
- **Manual Voting Closure:** Proposal creators and chairmen can close voting manually.
- **Proposal Results:** Retrieve proposal details and results transparently.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Interact with the smart contract through a sleek and intuitive web interface.

## Smart Contract Details

The `DAOcooperative.sol` smart contract is the backbone of this DApp. It manages members, proposals, and the voting process. Below are the key components of the smart contract:

### Roles

- **Chairman:** Has the authority to register members and close voting manually.
- **Member:** Can create and vote on proposals.

### Structs

- **Member:** Stores member ID, address, and active status.
- **Option:** Represents a voting option with a description and vote count.
- **Proposal:** Contains proposal ID, creator, description, voting end time, options, and status.

### Functions

- **registerMember(address newMember):** Registers a new member (only callable by the chairman).
- **createProposal(string description, uint256 votingDurationMinutes, string[] options):** Creates a new proposal with specified options (only callable by members).
- **vote(uint256 proposalId, uint256 optionIndex):** Casts a vote on a proposal (only callable by members).
- **closeVoting(uint256 proposalId):** Closes the voting for a proposal manually (only callable by the proposal creator or chairman).
- **closeExpiredProposals():** Automatically closes proposals whose voting period has ended.
- **getProposalDetails(uint256 proposalId):** Retrieves the details of a proposal.
- **getProposalResults(uint256 proposalId):** Retrieves the results of a closed proposal.
- **getTotalMembers():** Returns the total number of registered members.
- **getPendingProposalsToVote():** Returns a list of proposals that the member has not voted on.
- **getVotedProposals():** Returns a list of proposals that the member has voted on.
- **getNotVotedProposals():** Returns a list of proposals that the member has not voted on.
- **getActiveProposals():** Returns a list of active proposals.
- **getClosedProposals():** Returns a list of closed proposals.
- **getMemberInfo(address memberAddress):** Retrieves the details of a member.

## DApp Interface

The DApp interface is built with React and interacts with the smart contract using Web3.js. It provides a user-friendly way to manage members, create proposals, vote, and retrieve proposal details and results.

### Key Components

- **Register Member:** Form to register a new member.
- **Create Proposal:** Form to create a new proposal with multiple voting options.
- **Vote on Proposal:** Form to cast a vote on a proposal.
- **Close Voting:** Button to manually close the voting on a proposal.
- **Get Proposal Details:** Button to retrieve and display proposal details.
- **Get Proposal Results:** Button to retrieve and display proposal results.
- **Active Proposals:** Button to display a list of active proposals.
- **Closed Proposals:** Button to display a list of closed proposals.
- **Total Members:** Button to display the total number of registered members.
